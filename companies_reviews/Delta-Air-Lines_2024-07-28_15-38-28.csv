There's so much gossip rumor fighting arguing going on. I learned that you really can't trust management. They say they're all about safety safety is number one safety is this safety is that. But when it comes down to it you get a nice big cut on your knee your shift ends and then they hold you over for another 5 hours. Or you hurt your back and you end up going home within the next day they bring you into their office and you get in trouble for leaving during  mandatory overtime. You get paid decent depending on where you live in the country minus the Fact that you're working with multi million dollar equipment, dangerous environments, and worst of all terrible management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with all the management and lies that they say. The fact that they're able to mandatory overtime you without giving you any notice. But there are some good things about the job as well like some of the coworkers you work with you do start a friend group. At my last airline station everyone knew everyone everyone liked each other for the most part. Management was way better. Way understaffed and nobody complained. I've been there for three years and I feel like they still don't appreciate anyone no matter if we work hard or if you work slow you're treated the same.",2024-06-30,"Green Bay, WI",Ramp Agent/Baggage Handler,Current Employee,2.0,,,,,,Free flights,"Management, Dangerous environment"
